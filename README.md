# Image Processing with Python

A lesson teaching foundational image processing skills with Python and [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/).

## Lesson Content

This lesson introduces fundamental concepts in image handling and processing. Learners will gain the skills needed to load images into Python, to select, summarise, and modify specific regions in these image, and to identify and extract objects within an image for further analysis.

The lesson assumes a working knowledge of Python and some previous exposure to the Bash shell.
A detailed list of prerequisites can be found in [`learners/prereqs.md`](learners/prereqs.md).

## Multidimensional Data Episode

There is an extra episode covering analysis of multidimensional data (3D stacks and timelapses) including use of the [Napari](https://napari.org/stable/) image viewer. This additional episode is not part of the official [Carpentries Image Processing with Python lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/image-processing/). It was developed by [Jeremy Pike](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/arc/rsg/staff/jeremy-pike.aspx) from the [Research Software Group](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/arc/rsg/bear-software.aspx) and the
[Institute for Interdisciplinary Data Science and AI](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/data-science/index.aspx) at the University of Birmingham.
